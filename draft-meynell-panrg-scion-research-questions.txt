1.  Introduction

   SCION is an inter-domain network architecture.  Its core components
   specification, as deployed by some of its early adopters, is outlined
   in [I-D.scion-dataplane], [I-D.scion-cppki], [I-D.scion-cp],
   currently under ISE review.

   The goal of this draft is to explore how SCION and its early
   deployments try to address open research questions in [RFC9217].
   Specifically, there are still many open areas of research around
   path-aware networking, where SCION with its early deployment
   experiences and research efforts can provide a contribution.  This
   can also be a starting point for discussions around long-term
   protocol evolution.

   This draft assumes the reader is familiar with some of the
   fundamental concepts defined in the components specification.

   *Note:* This is the very first version of the SCION research
   questions draft, and it merely contains a skeleton of potential
   topics to be further discussed in this draft.  Any feedback is
   welcome and much appreciated.  Thanks!

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Discovery, Distribution, and Trustworthiness of Path Properties

3.1.  ISD, AS identity

   *  How many ASes do we expect in the SCION network model?

   *  How many ISDs?  What is the ontology of an ISD?  Per geographic
      area only?

   *  One AS belongs to many ISDs?

3.2.  Segment Dissemination

   Control servers return a large number of path segments.  This can
   cost considerable bandwidth / network egress while at the same time
   overloading clients with an unnecessarily large numbers of segments,
   mostly consisting of redundant information in terms of duplicate link
   and hops.

   *  This problem may be more problematic in ASes with many end hosts
      (e.g.  IoT), or end hosts with little computing power or little
      spare bandwidth.

   *  Getting a full path to a remote endhost may require three round-
      trips with the control server.

   There are multiple possible and independent solution steps here:

   *  Compression (idea suggested by Francois Wirz): Segments could be
      stored in a way that duplicate information (hops & links) is only
      stored once and the segments contain only references to the hops
      and links.

   *  Allow queries from start AS to end AS across multiple segments.
      This should be very easy to implement and would be compatible with
      the current wire protocol (protobuf).

      -  This would reduce the number of round trips to one.

      -  It would reduce the number of returned segments because only
         segments that actually connect to other segments would need to
         be returned.

   *  Predefine some policies that can be resolved by the control
      server, e.g.  ANY, BEST_LATENCY, BEST_BANDWIDTH, BEST_PRICE,
      BEST_CO2.  For these, a control server could simply calculate 5-10
      good paths and return these.  Moreover these could be cached for
      commonly requested remote ASs.  If a user requires a custom policy
      they can still resort to requesting actual segments.

   Doing path computation on the control server will initially increase
   computational cost.  However, it would substantially decrease network
   egress.  Caching of paths should reduce CPU cost, maybe even below
   the current cost for retrieving a large amount of segments from the
   local database and sending them over the network interface.

3.3.  Routing Policies and Traffic Engineering

   Reduced adoption due to limited routing policy possibilities, such as
   a (core-)AS does not want to accept transit traffic unless it starts/
   ends in ASs with special properties.  For example a GEANT AS does not
   want to allow transit traffic unless it originates or ends in another
   research AS.

   One solution could be to add a “confirm full path”-flag to certain
   segments.  If this flag is set, the full path (all segments) needs to
   authorized by all ASes that insist on authorizing it.  This is
   obviously less scalable but may be viable for ASes that insist on
   such policies.  This also allows for “secret” policies.

   Collateral: this probably needs a data plane change.  Conceptually,
   we have only a single resulting segment, and that segment needs to be
   used in full, e.g. no on-path trickery.

3.4.  DRKey

   *  Is forward-secrecy DRKey useful and should we develop it?

   *  What are the properties of the control-plane?

      -  Do we want to have any authorization of the data-plane transit
         undertaken at this stage?

      -  Would this obsolete firewalls?

      -  What do we mean when we say "authorize transit"?

   For more info: [I-D.garciapardo-drkey].

3.5.  SCMP Authentication

3.6.  Proof of transit

   FABRID [KRAHENBUHL2023] and EPIC [LEGNER2020].

3.7.  NAT

   At this moment, the SCION implementation is not compatible out-of-
   the-box with NAT'ed devices, whether these devices are end-hosts, or
   even running SCION services.  This is due to the (UDP-IP) underlay
   being modified by the NAT mechanism, but not the internal destination
   SCION address.  Although this does not concern the SCION protocols
   themselves, we want to check that this will not be a problem.

   *  With IPv6 underlay, this problem disappears.

   *  Modify the SCION border router to also act as a STUN server.

4.  Dataplane stability

4.1.  Link load balancing

   Links may get overloaded because the SCION routing system fails to
   distribute load properly over different links.  New/different links
   might be underutilized.

   If links become overloaded, there are several ways to handle that.
   Non comprehensively:

   *  Squeeze: send an SCMP message to trigger end-hosts to use an
      alternative path

   *  Steer: send and SCMP to trigger users to ask CS for a better path

   *  Reduce: hand over very short lived paths, let the end-hosts wait
      for the path to expire so that they request new paths and
      (hopefully) decide on a different path.

   *  Recommend: let the end-hosts know which paths are recommended by
      the AS at this time.

   If a link has good properties, many AS will disseminate segments,
   therefore paths that go through this link and the link may become
   overloaded.  See Simon Scherrer's work on Braess Paradox.

   Either there needs to be some constant control by all clients to not
   choose the best theoretical path, but the one that works best.  Or we
   need to find a way that control servers do not disseminate “good”
   links to all end-hosts.

   The current consensus is that end-hosts can use multi-pathing and
   “automatically” converge on the best path, i.e. creating an
   equilibrium.  Again, see Simon Scherrer's work on Braess Paradox.

4.2.  Reverse Path Refreshment

   When a client contacts a server, it is usually understood that it
   wants the server to use the reverse path to answer back.  It the
   server uses that path for a long period of time, the path will
   eventually expire.  How to standardize the process of refreshment?

   *  The server must ask the CS for a path, regardless of the client's
      policy.

   *  The client (somehow) sends a new packet with a new path, prompting
      the server to use this path from now on.

   There are some nuances: Usually the server's API will store the
   initial address of the client to be used through all the session.  We
   might need to take this into account.

5.  Hummingbird / QoS

   *  How many QoS flows to support at core routers?

   *  How does QoS interact with Net Neutrality?

   *  What proof of transit (or forwarding failure detection) is needed
      or wanted?

   *  What time synchronization precision should we expect at the border
      router level of every AS?  How far can we go realistically?

6.  Interfaces for Path Awareness

   *  IPv6 in the Data Plane

   *  SCION-IP translation

    Layers
