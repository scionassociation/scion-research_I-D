In effect, an endpoint may have more than 5 paths available, but they are likely to be very similar and may not offer the choice that an endpoint desires?\r\n\r\n",

Maybe some PCBs have a good bandwidth, but many were already filtered by \"A\".\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nIf ASes forward _all received beacons_ (in general, and assuming there is no expiration time inside the PCBs), there should not be a problem, since all paths will be eventually discovered.\r\n\r\nNow, because reality is that ASes cannot forward all of the PCBs, the non forwarded PCBs (those that an AS never forwards) are the least interesting ones _according to the local criteria of that AS_, which may or may not coincide with that criteria of the next neighbors this PCB will encounter.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be clearer if explained in terms of completeness of the graph exploration vs. time needed for it.",

I think it doesn't really matter how many combinations are available. If ISD start being used as \"types\", many of them may contain an identical set of ASes. We may still run out of ISD numbers, even if the number of actually used combinations is quite low....\r\n",

I've added some specific comments above, then some more general comments: \r\n- I feel that overall the key question about beaconing is to improve the tradeoffs between scalability/finding sufficient paths and doing it quickly. I'd try to highlight that in the text\r\n- This topics connects to question 2.7  of RFC9217 (and also a bit 2.8)\r\n  > Competing control inputs from path-aware endpoints and the routing control plane may lead to more difficult traffic engineering or non-convergent forwarding, especially if the endpoints' and operators' notion of the \"best\" path for given traffic diverges significantly. \r\n  \r\n  I'd mention that, and that this has implications for traffic engineering. This is a question that we get a lot at IETF. I'd almost call this paragraph `Beacon optimization and traffic engineering` if this could fit..",
