How do we recover from faulty segments?\r\nCurrently only endpoints may realize that a segment does not work as advertised, either via SCMP errors or simply by traffic degradation.\r\nThis would be a possible sequence of events:\r\n\r\n* An endpoint realizes that a segment is faulty\r\n* An endpoint needs to signal to its local AS that a segment is faulty\r\n* A Local AS needs to signal to a core AS that a segment is faulty\r\n* A core AS needs to:\r\n  * change policy to exclude faulty segments AND/OR\r\n  * signal other cores and ISDs to stop delivering the segment (they only deliver 5 each, so any faulty segment shoud be avoided)\r\n\r\n### Implications\r\n\r\nBesides general service degradation, a lack of recovery can worsen the impact of a wormhole attack {{I-D.scion-cp}}.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n\r\n* An AS could monitor traffic for SCMP errors, although this only works if these errors are actually generated and forwarded.\r\n* Endpoints need a way to signal faulty segments to ASes. ASes need a way to signal faulty ASes to other ASes (e.g.\r\ncore ASes or ASes in other ISDs).\r\n* ASes need adaptive beacon analysis algorithms that allow excluding specific beacons, e.g. beacons that have\r\n  known malicious ASes on path.\r\n* For swift recovery, it would be useful if ASes could communicate the faultiness of faulty segments.\r\n```",

Maybe some PCBs have a good bandwidth, but many were already filtered by \"A\".\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nIf ASes forward _all received beacons_ (in general, and assuming there is no expiration time inside the PCBs), there should not be a problem, since all paths will be eventually discovered.\r\n\r\nNow, because reality is that ASes cannot forward all of the PCBs, the non forwarded PCBs (those that an AS never forwards) are the least interesting ones _according to the local criteria of that AS_, which may or may not coincide with that criteria of the next neighbors this PCB will encounter.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be clearer if explained in terms of completeness of the graph exploration vs. time needed for it.",

          "body": "Hi Ali, thanks a lot for this initial text. I've added some specific comments above, then some more general comments: \r\n- I feel that overall the key question about beaconing is to improve the tradeoffs between scalability/finding sufficient paths and doing it quickly. I'd try to highlight that in the text\r\n- This topics connects to question 2.7  of RFC9217 (and also a bit 2.8)\r\n  > Competing control inputs from path-aware endpoints and the routing control plane may lead to more difficult traffic engineering or non-convergent forwarding, especially if the endpoints' and operators' notion of the \"best\" path for given traffic diverges significantly. \r\n  \r\n  I'd mention that, and that this has implications for traffic engineering. This is a question that we get a lot at IETF. I'd almost call this paragraph `Beacon optimization and traffic engineering` if this could fit..",
